# Working in Bash

## Introduction

Unix is simply a computer operating operating system. 

Bash, on the other hand, is a shell. Shells are command line interfaces where where you can communcate with the computer via certain commands. Lets explore some commands. Feel free to test these on your machine in a terminal. 

### Basic Commands

#### pwd 

The command 'pwd' will display the current working directory. Directories are file systems that contain references to other durectories and files.

#### ls

In order to view the files contained within the directory, we can use the command 'ls'. This will list the files and sub-directories in the current worrking directory

#### cd 

'cd' stands for change directory and will change the working directory to a specified directory using a file path. By just entering cd, you will directed to your home directory

#### mkdir

With the 'mkdir' command, a new directory will be created with the name we provide within the current working directory.

#### touch and nano

The 'touch' command will create a new file within the current working directory.

Heres and example

```{bash}
pwd
mkdir Example
cd Example/
pwd
touch exampleTextFile.txt
ls
```

## Working with Data using Bash

Bash is very powerful when working with data. Let's explore an example of some data analysis using bash commands.

First, we will retrieve some data using the 'wget' command. This command will dowload data from a URL and save it to the current durectory.

--
For Mac users: 

If the wget command returns the error 'wget: command not found', then run 

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

followed by 

brew install wget

This process installs Homebrew, which is a package manager for missing packages on macOS.
--

```{bash}
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/us-weather-history/KNYC.csv
```

Now, we can view the first n rows of the data. In this example, we will view the first five lines

```{bash}
head -n5 KNYC.csv
```

Another helpful way to view data is to save subsets of data to seperate files. 

Here we save the first 10 lines to a new file called short.csv.

```{bash}
head -n10 KNYC.csv >short.csv
```

Now we can view the whole file using the 'cat' command.

```{bash}
cat short.csv
```

We can also view specifc columns from our data using 'cut'.

```{bash}
cut -d, -f1,4 short.csv
```

Next, lets look at a specific row by using the 'grep' command to search by date.

```{bash}
grep 2015-2-23 KNYC.csv
```


## Bash Scripts

Now that we have covered some of the basics of bash, let's explore a powerful tool within bash called bash scripting. Writing bash srcipts is similar to any other program where each new line is a command with an intent to build upon previous computations. 

We can create files that will perform the tasks within. Consider this:

If we want to write some bash commands that will write the time of day to a file we can do something like

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
touch myDateFile.txt
date >>myDateFile.txt
```

running these commands each time we would like to write the date to the .txt file would begin to be tedius after time. Bash scripts provide an easy solution!

First, we will create a new .sh file.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
touch myDateBash.sh
```

Then, using a text editor, we can edit the file and enter our code to write the date to myDateFile.txt. 

Paste the following command into a terminal (be sure your working directory is the same directory as where you saved your bash file):

vi myDateBash.sh

You will be presented with a screen that looks like the following image.

<center>![Figure 1](images/vim.png){width=75%}</center>

Then, type the letter i to enter "Insert Mode" and write in date >>myDateFile.txt. Then, click escape on your keyboard and then type ":wq". You should now be back to a normal Terminal setting.

Next, we need to set the file permisions. Paste "chmod +x myDateBash.sh" into the terminal. 

Great! Now the setup is complete and we can run the bash script to write the current date and time to. myDateFile.txt like this:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
./myDateBash.sh
```


Lastly, to view the contents of the date text file:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cat myDateFile.txt
```
