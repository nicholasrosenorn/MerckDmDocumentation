Start by opening up a terminal and configuring git to work with GitHub. Navigate to the directory in which you would like to clone the-examples-book repository. For example, if I wanted to clone the repository in my ~/projects folder, I'd first execute: cd ~/projects. Clone the repository. In this example, let's assume I've cloned the repository into my ~/projects folder. Navigate into the project folder: cd ~/projects/the-examples-book At this point in time your current branch should be the master branch. You can verify by running: git branch Note: The highlighted branch starting with &quot;*&quot; is the current branch. or if you'd like just the name of the branch: git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD Create a new branch with whatever name you'd like, and check that branch out. For example, fix-spelling-errors-01. Open up RStudio. In the &quot;Files&quot; tab in RStudio, navigate to the repository. In this example, we would navigate to /Users/kamstut/Documents/GitHub/the-examples-book. Click on the &quot;More&quot; dropdown and select &quot;Set As Working Directory&quot;. If you do not already have renv installed, install it by running the following commands in the console: install.packages(&quot;renv&quot;) Restore the environment by running the following commands in the console: renv::restore() In order to compile this book, you must have LaTeX installed. The easiest way to accomplish this is to run the following in the R console: install.packages(&quot;tinytex&quot;) library(tinytex) tinytex::install_tinytex() In addition, make sure to install both pandoc and pandoc-citeproc by following the instructions here. Modify the .Rmd files to your liking. Click the &quot;Knit&quot; button to compile the book. The resulting &quot;book&quot; is within the &quot;docs&quot; folder. Important note: If at any point in time you receive an error saying something similar to &quot;there is no package called my_package, simply install the missing package, and try to knit again: install.packages(&quot;my_package&quot;) library(my_package) To test the book out, navigate to the &quot;docs&quot; folder and open the index.html in the browser of your choice. When you are happy with the modifications you've made, commit your changes to the repository. You can continue to make modifications and commit your changes locally. When you are ready, you can push your branch to the remote repository (github.com). At this point in time, you can confirm that the branch has been succesfully pushed to github.com by navigating to the repository on github, and click on the &quot;branches&quot; tab: Next, create a pull request. Note that a &quot;Pull Request&quot; is a GitHub-specific concept. You cannot create a pull request using git.

You can click on &quot;Preview&quot; to see what your comment will look like. GitHub's markdown applies here. Once satisfied, click &quot;Create pull request&quot;.
