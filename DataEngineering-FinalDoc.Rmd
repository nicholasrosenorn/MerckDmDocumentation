## Introduction to the Team- everyone

Include a brief sentence including your name, major, year, and relevant experience to the data mine.

Eric Yap: I am sophomore majoring in data science and finance. Most of my classes have helped developed my Python and R skills, which are very transferable to the work I do in the data mine.
Allison Hill: I am a senior majoring in electrical engineering. I have coding experience in various languages, including some Python and R which were used within this project.


## Semester Goals - Pranav

Include a brief overview of the project scope and the data engineering's role within the project. 
Also include our team's semester's goals.

## Data Overview - Jennifer

Discuss Apple vs Fitbit data available 
Discuss what type of data was included in our scope
Discuss potential ideas for data cleaning and handling missing data

## Scaling the Framework

### Multiple Users - Joshua

### Multiple Devices - Allison
Not all fitbit devices have the same data available to them. This is most noticeable in older models, in which functionality such as the number of floors climbed or sleep cycles was not yet implemented. Using the get_Devices function available in the Fitbit API, the code returns a string corresponding to the Fitbit version. For example, a Fitbit Ionic would return the string "Ionic". Using this information, if-else statements were implemented to check the version and assign corresponding data values. Data that is not available would be input as "None" within the data table. In some cases, the function can simply check if the data is NULL and automatically do this such as with the sleep data. However for data such as activity levels, the data gets input as a "0" instead and thus needs a check. Checks for some of the newer models have been implemented, along with a generic case. The table below shows the implemented models and their available data:

## Scheduling the Data Collection - Eric

Through using the CronTab module within Python, we are able to schedule and run our FitBit functions on a routinely basis. The data we collect is stored in a dataframe and new data is continuously appended to this dataframe. The scheduled time is set to every 9 AM on weekdays.



## Collaborating with other Teams - Karthik

## Future Work - Jennifer

Include: streamlining our work with the other groups (see above); Potentially changing the way we are accessing the userâ€™s fitbit info; Apple watch data collection
